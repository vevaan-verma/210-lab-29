/*
Project Overview:
	This project simulates the atmosphere of different stages at a very large 25 hour music festival. It aims to reveal which features of concerts are appealing to audiences, which can be used by other artists when planning their own concerts.

Implementation:
	An std::map will contain the data of each stage at the festival. The map's key will be the name of each stage, while the value will be an std::array that contains three std::lists. The lists will contain the genres of music being played (eg. pop, rock, EDM, hip-hop), the artists performing on that stage (eg. The Weeknd, Dua Lipa, Travis Scott), and the weather (eg. sunny, rainy, cloudy), respectively. One map entry would be for the main stage (named "Main Stage"), with the lists containing the genre(s) of music being performed on that stage, the artists performing, and the weather. Another entry would be the "DJ Set", which would contain a different set of genres and artists, and possibly different weather as well.

Simulated Events:
	The simulation will focus on three events: artist changes, song genre changes, and weather effects that push crowds to different stages. During a specific hour, the crowd may be completely pushed to a different stage due to bad weather conditions, an artist change, or a genre change.
